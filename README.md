## Cisco Packet Tracer  

**Cisco Packet Tracer** is a network simulation tool developed by Cisco that allows users to design, configure, and troubleshoot network topologies in a virtual environment.  

## Hospital Management Network â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer  

I designed and implemented a **Hospital Management Network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer** to ensure seamless communication and efficient data management within the hospital.  

### Network Components:  
- **Switches & Routers:** Facilitate internal and external network communication.  
- **PCs/Laptops:** Used by hospital staff for accessing patient records, managing appointments, and administrative tasks.  

### Implemented Servers:  
- **DNS Server:** Resolves domain names to IP addresses for efficient network access.  
- **Web Server:** Hosts hospital websites and internal portals for staff and patients.  
- **DHCP Server:** Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices for streamlined connectivity.  
- **FTP Server:** Enables secure file transfers for medical reports, patient records, and administrative data.
